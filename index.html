    <h1>Notes from the first lesson.</h1>

<h3>The Internet</h3>
<p>...is a bunch of computers <em>"talking"</em> to each other!</p>

<h3>The World Wide Web</h3>
<p>...is a large collections of interlinked files. The majority of the content is contained within HTML <em>(Hypertext Markup Language)</em> documents.</p>

<p>You sit at your computer interfacing with the internet, primarily through your browser. Servers hold the information, and the info is transmitted via a protocol called HTTP. </p>

<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>...documents are made up of the content <em>(the <b>what</b> of it all)</em> and the markup <em>(how the "what" <b>looks</b>)</em>! (Ok, ok...Let's stop sounding like the caterpillar from <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>.)</p>

<p>Some of the inline tags learned in this lesson were:
  <br />
  <span>-Span</span>
  <br /> -
  <b>Bold</b>
  <br /> -
  <em>em</em>
  <br /> And, of course, the br tag, which has helped us format this list, even without using an ul! (We also learned the img tag, but let's not insert pics here yet.)
</p>

<div>
  <p>We also learned a couple block tags, including: "div" and "p". (The block tags have an "invisible box" around them.)</p>
</div>

<p>We took a look at the general layout of an element, which included the tag itself, the attribute(s) with their values, and for tags other than the void ones, the content within.</p>

<h3>Computers are "Stupid"</h3>
<p>They just follow our instructions, even though some of those instructions might be fairly complex! (Until the robot uprising, that is! LOL.) This gives us the opportunity to wield a lot of control with our instructions. But it also means that we have
  to issue those instructions very accurately.</p>
